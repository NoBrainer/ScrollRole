# Configuration

The configuration is a YAML file. (Check out [YAML Version 1.2](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) for details on
the YAML specifications.)

## TERMINOLOGY

The YAML documentation refers to a list of things as a `collection.` Instead, I will call each of these a `list`.

Example:
```yaml
# Here is a list of items:
- item
- item
```

The documentation also refers to each key-value pair as a `mapping`. I will call each of these an `attribute`, a
`mapping`, or an `object`, depending on the context.

Example:
```yaml
# Here is the name attribute:
name: Uncle Rufus
 
# The proficiencies attribute is a list of objects. Each object has the 'type' attribute.
proficiencies:
  - { type: skill, name: Insight }
  - { type: skill, name: Religion }
```

## GENERAL OBJECTS ##

### Overview on Objects
Whenever two Lists are applicable, the Lists are combined. For instance, if a sub-race provided your character with a
list of features, those features are added to your other List of features.

All Lists default to an empty List if they are not required.

### Ability Score Adjustment Object
Each Ability Score Adjustment Object represents an ability score modifier from the base value.

- `ability`: (REQUIRED) String for the ability (`STR` | `DEX` | `CON` | `WIS` | `INT` | `CHA`)
- `modifier`: (REQUIRED) Number for the modifier

Example:
```yaml
abilityScoreAdjustments:
  - { ability: CON, modifier: +2 }
  ...
```

### Choice Object
Each Choice Object represent a decision the player needs to make.

- `name`: String
- `description`: List of paragraph Strings
- `type`: (REQUIRED) String for the type of thing being picked (`abilityScoreAdjustment` | `equipment` | `feature` |
`proficiency`)
- `pick`: (REQUIRED) Number of things to be picked
- `options`: Object or String of things to pick from. If it's an Object, it can be an Ability Score Adjustment Object,
Feature Object, or Proficiency Object. (Must have this or `from`.)
- `from`: Object defining part or all of a predefined List. This is an alternative to `options`. (See: 
[List Selector Object](#list-selector-object))
- `allowDuplicate`: Boolean of whether or not to allow picking duplicates. (default: false)
- `use`: Object to use instead of defining an Choice Object. The Object being used will be overridden by fields in the
Choice Object using it.

Example:
```yaml
choices:
  - name: Tool Proficiency
    description:
      - >
        You gain proficiency with the artisan's tool of your choice: smith's tools,
        brewer's supplies, or mason's tools.
    type: proficiency
    pick: 1
    options:
      - { type: tool, name: smith's tools }
      ...
```

Example:
```yaml
choices:
  - name: Ability Score Modifier 1
    use: abilityScoreImprovement
```
